# About

Hive Search is an external tool for Minecraft speedrunning that allows multiple people to search through worlds and then quickly setup a server to allow everyone to join.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project has been halted due to creation of Minecraft mods with the same purpose, which was originally blocked by speedrunning rules.
> The current project contains a bunch of interfaces for Minecraft as well as a simple speedrunning timer.
